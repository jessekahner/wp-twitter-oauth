wp-twitter-oauth
================
Using the [**Twitter API 1.1 Client for Wordpress**](https://github.com/micc83/Twitter-API-1.1-Client-for-Wordpress),
this is a *not so* simple function to show a tweet inside of a Wordpress site.

This was rewritten because of the changes to the Twitter API.



##TO-DO
* Show more than one tweet
* Many, many more
